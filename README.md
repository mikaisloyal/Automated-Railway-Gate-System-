# Automated Railway Gate System â€“ Digital Logic Simulation

This digital logic project simulates an automated railway gate controller using binary sensor input, logic gates, and finite state machine principles.

## Features
- 5-state truth table-based gate control system
- Simulates inputs from sensors (Train A, Train B, Vehicle presence, Train speed)
- Gate logic modeled using Boolean algebra, combinational logic, and flip-flops
- Fail-safe logic included for real-time dynamic changes

##  Tools & Technologies
- Truth Tables & State Diagrams
- Boolean Logic and Karnaugh Maps
- Digital Circuit Design Principles
- Visual signal emulation (LED/LCD output representation)

## Output
- Simulated railway gate control states with step-by-step logic execution
- Visual illustrations of logic gates and signal pathways
- Documentation includes control logic table and simulation flowchart
